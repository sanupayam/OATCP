2. Initialization: Initialize variables `missing` to 1 (representing the smallest number not yet covered), `patches` to 0 (representing the number of patches applied), and `i` to 0 (representing the current index in the `nums` array).

3. Patch Calculation: Enter a loop that continues until `missing` is greater than `n`. Inside the loop:
    - Check if the current index `i` is within the bounds of `nums` and if the element at `nums[i]` is less than or equal to `missing`.
    - If the condition is true, it means the current element at `nums[i]` can cover the range up to `missing`. Thus, increment `missing` by `nums[i]` and move to the next element by incrementing `i`.
    - If the condition is false, it means the current element at `nums[i]` cannot cover the range up to `missing`. In this case, double the value of `missing` to extend the range, and increment `patches` to count the added patch.

4. Loop Termination: Exit the loop when `missing` becomes greater than `n`, indicating that all numbers up to `n` are covered.

5. Output: Print the minimum number of patches required, represented by the value of `patches`.
