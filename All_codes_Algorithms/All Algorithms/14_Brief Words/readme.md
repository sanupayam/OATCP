

1. Include Libraries: Include necessary libraries (`bits/stdc++.h`) for standard input-output operations and file handling.

2. Generate Subsequences Function: Define a function `genSubsequences` that generates all subsequences of a given string `str` with a specified length `length`. The function takes parameters `str` (the original string), `current` (the current subsequence being formed), `index` (the current index in the original string), and `length` (the length of subsequences to generate). The function returns a vector of strings containing all generated subsequences.

3. Main Function:
    - Open the input file for reading and output file for writing.
    - Read the integer `n` representing the number of strings.
    - Initialize a set `st` to store unique subsequences.
    - Initialize a 2D vector `vs` to store subsequences for each input string.
    - Loop `n` times to read each input string `s`.
    - For each input string, generate subsequences of lengths 1 to 4 using the `genSubsequences` function and store them in a vector `ans`.
    - Store `ans` in `vs`.
    - Write the generated subsequences to the output file, ensuring uniqueness using the set `st`.
    - Close the input and output files.

4. Output Formatting:
    - For each input string, print its generated subsequences to the standard output and write them to the output file.
    - Separate subsequences of different input strings with an empty line in both standard output and output file.

5. File Handling and Closure:
    - Close the input and output files after processing is completed.
