The comparison is done in a way that forms the largest number. For example, given two integers `a` and `b`, `a` should be placed before `b` if the concatenation of `a` and `b` results in a larger number than the concatenation of `b` and `a`.

2. Sorting: Sort the input vector `nums` using the custom comparator `customCompare` defined in step 1. This sorting rearranges the numbers in a way that forms the largest number when concatenated.

3. Handling the Largest Number as 0: Check if the first element of the sorted vector is 0. If it is, return "0" as the result since the largest number formed will be 0 if 0 is the largest digit.

4. Concatenating Numbers: Initialize an empty string `result` to store the concatenated numbers. Iterate through the sorted vector `nums` and convert each number to a string using `to_string()`. Append each string representation of a number to the `result` string.

5. Output: Return the `result` string, which represents the largest number formed by concatenating the elements of the input vector in a way that maximizes the resulting number.
